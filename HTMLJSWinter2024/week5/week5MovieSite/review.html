            <!--insert trivia here-->
            <p> 1. Ashley Peldon, who plays Little Elizabeth, grew up to become a professional scream artist! She puts in the screams for actors in different movies and TV shows!
                Grandma Bunce is played by the director’s mother. There is a scene where she gets paint thrown at her, yogurt was used. She said she was still finding yogurt in her ears weeks later.

                3. When viewing a rough cut of the film one New Line executive asked if Rik Mayall's character could be re-dubbed so as to speak with less of a strong English accent and more of a transatlantic one so US audiences wouldn't find it so jarring. When one of the Working Title producers rang Mayall to pass on the suggestion, Mayall typically replied "You must be joking, I'm Rik '12 inches of throbbing manhood' Mayall and I'm English. If he wants a transatlantic voice then give him a shovel and tell him to dig up Cary 'bloody' Grant". Needless to say that the idea was soon dropped.
